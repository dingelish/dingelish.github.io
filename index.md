# Rust SGX SDK Documents

We provide documents for our [Rust SGX SDK](https://github.com/baidu/rust-sgx-sdk). These documents are automatically generated by using `cargo doc` in each crate, and will update immediately on new SDK release. 

* [sgx_types](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_types/sgx_types/index.html) contains basic data type definitions and macros.
* [sgx_tstdc](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_types/sgx_tstdc/index.html) provides basic Mutex/Condition/Spinlock support.
* [sgx_trts](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_trts/sgx_trts/index.html) is SGX trusted runtime system (tRTS), provides the enclave entry point logic as well as other functions to be used by enclave developers.
* [sgx_tservice](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tservice/sgx_tservice/index.html) provides APIs interact with Intel Trusted Platform Service. 
* [sgx_tcrypto](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tcrypto/sgx_tcrypto/index.html) includes a trusted cryptography library. 
* [sgx_tse](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tse/sgx_tse/index.html) provides three key functions for attest an enclave.
* [sgx_tseal](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tseal/sgx_tseal/index.html) provides APIs for data sealing and unsealing.
* [sgx_tdh](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tdh/sgx_tdh/index.html) provides Diffie-Hellman session establishment APIs.
