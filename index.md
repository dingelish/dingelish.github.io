# Rust SGX SDK Documents

We provide documents for our [Rust SGX SDK](https://github.com/baidu/rust-sgx-sdk). These documents are automatically generated by using `cargo doc` in each crate, and will update immediately on new SDK release.

* [sgx_types](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_types/sgx_types/index.html) contains basic data type definitions and macros.
* [sgx_tstd](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tstd/sgx_tstd/index.html) provides almost all of compatible part of Rust `std`.
* [sgx_trts](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_trts/sgx_trts/index.html) is SGX trusted runtime system (tRTS), provides the enclave entry point logic as well as other functions to be used by enclave developers.
* [sgx_tservice](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tservice/sgx_tservice/index.html) provides APIs interact with Intel Trusted Platform Service.
* [sgx_tcrypto](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tcrypto/sgx_tcrypto/index.html) includes a trusted cryptography library.
* [sgx_tse](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tse/sgx_tse/index.html) provides three key functions for attest an enclave.
* [sgx_tseal](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tseal/sgx_tseal/index.html) provides APIs for data sealing and unsealing.
* [sgx_tdh](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tdh/sgx_tdh/index.html) provides Diffie-Hellman session establishment APIs.
* [sgx_tkey_exchange](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tkey_exchange/sgx_tkey_exchange/index.html) provides APIs for exchange secrets between server and enclaves.
* [sgx_alloc](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_alloc/sgx_alloc/index.html) provides the new alloc system in Rust SGX environment.
* [sgx_tprotected_fs](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tprotected_fs/sgx_tprotected_fs/index.html) provides the file system APIs in Rust SGX environment.
* [sgx_tunittest](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_tunittest/sgx_tunittest/index.html) provides the unit test driver APIs in Rust SGX environment.
* [sgx_rand](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_rand/sgx_rand/index.html), [sgx_rand_derive](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_rand_derive/sgx_rand_derive/index.html) provides Rust style PRNG interface in SGX.
* [sgx_serialize](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_serialize/sgx_serialize/index.html), [sgx_serialize_derive](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_serialize_derive/sgx_serialize_derive/index.html) and [sgx_serialize_derive_internals](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_serialize_derive_internals/sgx_serialize_derive_internals/index.html) provides Rust style data serialization and deserialization in SGX.
* [sgx_urts](https://dingelish.github.io/sgx_urts/sgx_urts/index.html) is the untrusted library for programming untrusted part in Rust.
